  <h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>Intellexa is a group of students and faculties that are psyched about AI and seek a forum to talk about it. We are dedicated to promote excellence and competence in the field of Artificial Intelligence and its underlying disciplines.</p>

<p>The focus of the club is primarily on combining theoritical knowledge with hands-on experience. We conduct workshops on Deep Learning which are handled by faculty pursuing reasearch in the field. These workshops are primarily focussed on giving the students a head start in the field of Deep Learning.</p>

<p>As a part of this effort, we have signed an agreement with Bennett University as a partner for increasing the knowledge pool in the technologies of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning in India. Prof.Deepak Garg, Bennett University, Noida has received funds from Royal Academy of UK, University College of London, NVIDIA, Amazon for the research Initiative titled “Making Deep Learning and AI skills mainstream in India to fulfill trilateral needs of entrepreneurship, Industry academia partnership and application-inspired Engineering Research”. As a partner of this research project, we have collaborated with Bennett University for the completion of the project by disseminating knowledge in AI and Deep Learning.
